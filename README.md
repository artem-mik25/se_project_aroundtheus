# Project 3: Around The U.S.

### Overview  

* Intro  
* Figma  
* Images  
  
**Intro**
  
I've developed a website that allows users to create profiles and share images, which can be viewed and liked by others. This project was constructed using HTML and CSS, incorporating media queries to ensure the site is responsive across various screen sizes.
  
**Figma**

**Images**  
  
The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster. 
  
Good luck and have fun!
